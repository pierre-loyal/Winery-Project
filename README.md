## Winery Project
* Analyzed wine quality using Python and statistics to advise on production improvements. Utilized Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas for data management and analysis.
* Created visualizations with Matplotlib to illustrate wine composition impact on quality, aiding in easier interpretation and decision-making for winery staff.
* Applied machine learning algorithms via Scikit-learn to predict wine quality based on ingredients, providing actionable insights for quality control and product development.
